- 👋 Hi, I’m @simba-g
- 👀 I’m interested in databases, distributed systems and Rust programming language.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning actor frameworks - actix, orleans and WASM/WASI for embedding scripting languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on service fabric, postgres, freta, avml, blender, freecad and Rust programming language. I like containerized dev/build environments.
